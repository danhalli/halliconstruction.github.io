<h1>Garage to ADU Conversion Roadmap: Portland 2026</h1>

<h2>Phase 1: The Administrative Intake</h2>

<p><strong>The DevHub Account</strong></p>
<p>
The Owner needs to create a profile on the City of Portland DevHub portal.
This is the digital command center where all plans are uploaded and where the City
will send corrections or approvals.
</p>
<p>
DevHub URL:<br>
https://devhub.portlandoregon.gov/
</p>

<p><strong>The Owner Doing Work Statement</strong></p>
<p>
Because the Owner is performing the electrical and plumbing labor, Oregon law
requires them to sign a specific affidavit. This confirms they are the property
owner and will be the one physically doing the trade work, which allows them to
bypass the requirement for a separate plumbing or electrical contractor license.

</p>

<p><strong>The SDC Waiver (The Tax Break)</strong></p>
<p>
This is the most important document for the budget. Portland charges System
Development Charges to cover the impact a new unit has on city parks, transit,
and sewers. For an ADU, these fees usually total 12000 to 20000 dollars.
</p>
<p>
The Deal: The city will waive these fees entirely if the Owner signs a Covenant
promising not to use the ADU as a short term rental for 10 years.
</p>
<p>
The Process: This form must be signed in front of a Notary Public and then recorded
with the County before the permit is issued.

</p>

<h2>Phase 2: The Rough In and Trade Labor</h2>

<p><strong>The Structural Shell</strong></p>
<p>
Contractor builds the foundation, walls, and exterior shell. Once the shell is up
but the interior studs are still exposed, the Owner steps in.
</p>

<p><strong>Running the Lines</strong></p>
<p>
The Owner installs the wiring, plumbing pipes, and HVAC ducting inside the open
walls, with consultation by the contractor.
</p>

<p><strong>The Critical Inspection</strong></p>
<p>
Before any insulation or drywall can be installed, the Owner must schedule a
Rough In inspection. A city inspector will verify that the plumbing and electrical
work meets current Oregon Residential Specialty Code.
</p>
<p>
The Contractor cannot close the walls until the Owner gets approval from this
inspection.
</p>

<h2>Phase 3: Final Completion and Occupancy</h2>

<p><strong>Closing the Walls</strong></p>
<p>
After the Owner trade work passes inspection, the Contractor installs insulation
and drywall.
</p>

<p><strong>Trim and Fixtures</strong></p>
<p>
The Owner installs finish items including outlets, light fixtures, sinks,
and toilets.
</p>

<p><strong>Final Inspection</strong></p>
<p>
The city performs a final walkthrough of the entire project. Once approved,
the Owner receives a Certificate of Occupancy, making the unit legally livable.

of 5.7 square feet and a sill height no higher than 44 inches from the floor.
