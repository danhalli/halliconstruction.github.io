<h1>Garage-to-ADU Conversion Roadmap: Portland 2026</h1>

<h2>Phase 1: The Administrative Intake</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>The DevHub Account</h3>
<p>
The Owner needs to create a profile on the City of Portland’s DevHub portal.
This is the digital command center where all plans are uploaded and where the city
will send corrections or approvals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>DevHub Portal:</strong><br>
<a href="https://devhub.portlandoregon.gov/" target="_blank">
https://devhub.portlandoregon.gov/
</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Owner Doing Work Statement</h3>
<p>
Because the Owner is performing the electrical and plumbing labor, Oregon law
requires them to sign a specific affidavit. This confirms they are the property
owner and will be the one physically doing the trade work, allowing them to bypass
the requirement for a separate plumbing or electrical contractor license.
</p>

</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>The SDC Waiver (The Tax Break)</h3>
<p>
Portland charges System Development Charges (SDCs) to cover the impact a new unit has
on city parks, transit, and sewers. For an ADU, these fees usually total $12,000 to
$20,000.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Deal:</strong> The city will waive these fees entirely if the Owner signs
a Covenant promising not to use the ADU as a short-term rental for 10 years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Process:</strong> This form must be signed in front of a Notary Public and
then recorded with the County before the permit is issued.
</p>
<p>

</p>
</div>

<h2>Phase 2: The Rough-In and Trade Labor</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Structural Shell</h3>
<p>
Contractor builds the foundation, walls, and exterior shell. Once the shell is up
but the interior studs are still exposed, the Owner steps in.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Running the Lines</h3>
<p>
The Owner installs the wiring, plumbing pipes, and HVAC ducting inside the open
walls, with consultation by the contractor.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>The Critical Inspection</h3>
<p>
Before any insulation or drywall can be installed, the Owner must schedule a
Rough-In inspection. A city inspector verifies that the plumbing and electrical work
meets current Oregon Residential Specialty Code requirements.
</p>
<p>
The Contractor cannot close the walls until this inspection is approved.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Phase 3: Final Completion and Occupancy</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>Closing the Walls</h3>
<p>
After the Owner’s trade work passes inspection, the Contractor installs insulation
and drywall.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Trim and Fixtures</h3>
<p>
The Owner installs finish items including outlets, light fixtures, sinks, and
toilets.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Final Inspection</h3>
<p>
The city performs a final walkthrough of the entire project. Once approved, the
Owner receives a Certificate of Occupancy, making the unit legally livable.
</p>
</div>
